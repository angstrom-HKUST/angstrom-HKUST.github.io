                Generative models are a class of machine learning models designed to estimate and sample from 
                a probability distribution.
                We propose a variational modelling method with differentiable temperature for canonical ensembles. 
                Using a deep generative model, the free energy is estimated and minimized simultaneously 
                in a continuous temperature range. 
                At optimal, this generative model is a Boltzmann distribution with temperature dependence. 
                The training process requires no dataset, and works with arbitrary tractable density generative models. 
                <!--- We applied our method to study the phase transitions (PT) in the Ising and XY models, 
                and showed that the direct-sampling simulation of our model is as accurate as 
                the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, but more efficient. 
                Moreover, our method can give thermodynamic quantities as differentiable functions of temperature 
                akin to an analytical solution. ---> 
                Our breakthrough suggests that deep-learning direct sampling could, in the future, 
                stand as an independent statistical mechanics method, 
                no longer reliant on Markov Chain Monte Carlo and serving as a compelling alternative

                The deep carbon cycle is of great importance in the Earth's carbon cycle, 
                responsible for global warming and climate change. Deep inside the Earth, great amount of carbon may be transported by water. 
                However, the forms of dissolved carbon in water under high pressure and high temperature conditions are not well known. 
                Herein, by conducting extensive first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, 
                we found the most of the dissolved carbon at 11 GPa and 1000 K is in the form of solvated carbonate and bicarbonate anions, 
                contrary to popular geochemical models assuming that CO<sub>2</sub> is the major carbon species present in water.  
                Our results suggest that at such extreme conditions water transports carbon mostly through highly active ions, not CO<sub>2</sub> molecules

                Water is a major component of fluids in the Earth's mantle, where its properties are substantially different from those at ambient conditions. 
                At the pressures and temperatures of the mantle, experiments on aqueous fluids are challenging, 
                and several fundamental properties of water are poorly known; e.g., its dielectric constant has not been measured. 
                This lack of knowledge of water dielectric properties has greatly limited our ability to model water-rock interactions and, 
                in general, our understanding of aqueous fluids below the Earth's crust. 
                Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we computed the dielectric constant of water under the conditions of the Earth's upper mantle, 
                and we predicted the solubility products of carbonate minerals [<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/17/6646.full">Pan et al. (2013)</a>]. 
                The computed dielectric constant of water has been implemented in the latest <a href="http://www.dewcommunity.org/">Deep Earth Water model</a>.

                Experimentally, it is not yet possible to measure absorption processes taking place in water and ice in diamond anvil cells. 
                The band gap of diamond is smaller than that of water and ice, at least up to 30 GPa, and at high temperatures water becomes corrosive. 
                We used ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations to show that both the refractive index 
                and the electronic gap of water and ice increase with increasing pressure (up to 30 GPa), 
                contrary to previous assumptions and contrary to the results of simple, widely used models. 
                Subtle electronic effects, related to the nature of inter-band transitions and band edge localization under pressure, 
                are responsible for this apparently anomalous behavior

                Ice Ih, the most common ice phase at ambient conditions, is a proton disordered crystal, 
                obeying so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_rules">Bernal-Fowler-Pauling rules</a>; 
                however, we found the ice surface is significantly more proton ordered than the ice bulk 
                [<a href="http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v101/i15/e155703">Pan et al. (2008)</a>]. 
                The ordered proton arrangements at the ice surface lead to a large variation of vacancy formation energies
